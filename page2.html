                <p style="margin: 0px;">17 Years Old</p>
                <p>
                    Peter Benjamin Parker is a 17-year-old student who balances the everyday struggles of adolescence
                    with the weight of having the big responsibility of being Spider-Man. Peter is intelligent, curious,
                    and naturally gifted in science, just like his father. He finds comfort in building gadgets and
                    taking pictures. Despite his gifts, he’s still figuring out who he is and where he belongs.

                <p><span class="challenges-heading">Discovering His Identity </span><br>
                    After getting bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter suddenly gains spider-like abilities he doesn’t
                    fully understand. He struggles to figure out what he should do with these powers and whether he
                    deserves them or not. This is where his journey as a Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man begins.
                </p>
                <p><span class="challenges-heading">Uncle Ben's Death </span><br>
                    After the death of Uncle Ben, Peter blames himself and becomes obsessed with tracking down the man
                    responsible. This guilt drives him into dangerous situations and clouds his judgment. The weight of
                    his emotions becomes one of the major struggles of his early life as Spider-Man.
                </p>
                <p><span class="challenges-heading"> Balancing School, Family, and Hero Life </span><br>
                    While being the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, Peter still has to deal with schoolwork, bullies,
                    relationships, and helping Aunt May at home. After Uncle Ben’s death, he takes on even more
                    responsibilities. His double life starts to wear him down, and he learns that being a hero means
                    sacrificing things for the greater good.

                <p><span class="challenges-heading">Keeping Gwen Safe</span><br>
                    One of Peter's biggest emotional conflicts is choosing between being with Gwen or staying away from
                    her because of the danger that being Spider-Man brings. Every time he gets close to her, he
                    remembers the promise he made to her father and sometimes hallucinates, and the guilt weighs heavily
                    on him. This struggle affects every decision he makes that involves Gwen.
                </p>
                <p><span class="challenges-heading">Helping Harry Osborn While Fighting Green Goblin</span><br>
                    After Harry's return, Peter's childhood friend, Harry has a deadly inherited disease and begs Peter
                    to help him meet Spider-Man. After meeting Spider-Man, he despirately asks for Spider-Man's blood,
                    but as
                    Spider-Man worries that giving his blood, might worsen Harry's condition and he might die, he
                    declined. When Harry
                    transforms into the Green Goblin, Peter struggles to fight him because he still believes that his
                    best friend is still
                    there.
                </p>
                <p><span class="challenges-heading">Losing Gwen</span><br>
                    When Gwen dies during the battle with the Green Goblin, Peter is devastated and reaches his lowest
                    point. He withdraws from being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and struggles to move forward
                    without her. This becomes the hardest emotional challenge he has ever faced as both a hero and as
                    Peter Parker.

                <p>
                    Dr. Curtis Connors, also known as <strong>The Lizard</strong>, is the main antagonist in The Amazing
                    Spider-Man
                    (2012) and Spider-Man's first villain. He is a brilliant scientist who works at Oscorp and was once
                    a close colleague of Peter Parker's father. Dr. Connors is very intelligent, kind-hearted, and
                    dedicated to finding scientific discoveries that could help people with disabilities, including
                    himself. <br>
                    His transformation begins when he experiments on himself with a serum made from cross-species
                    genetics from a lizard, hoping it will help him regrow his missing right arm and help other people.
                    His right arm did grow, but the serum also affected his body and mind, turning him into the Lizard.
                    This is where the conflict between the Lizard and Spider-Man begins, as Dr. Connors wants to release
                    the serum into the city, but Spider-Man knows it is dangerous and must stop him.

                <p>
                    Max Dillon, later known as <strong>Electro</strong>, is one of the main antagonists in The Amazing
                    Spider-Man 2
                    (2014). Before becoming Electro, Max is a shy, kind-hearted, but overlooked electrical engineer who
                    works at Oscorp. He is extremely intelligent and skilled with technology. But in his everyday life,
                    he feels invisible, no one notices him, and no one listens. This loneliness becomes a major part of
                    his character. <br>
                    Max idolizes Spider-Man because he sees him as someone who pays attention to people and treats them
                    kindly. After an accident involving electric eels and damaged power lines, Max gains the ability to
                    control, consume, and generate electricity. Although the transformation gives him incredible power,
                    it also affects his emotions and judgment.

                    childhood friend and the
                    heir to Oscorp. After returning to New York, he discovered that he has a rare illness passed down
                    from his father. Desperate in his search for a cure, he asked Spider-Man for help by requesting
                    Spider-Man's blood, but Spider-Man declined because their blood might not be compatible and it could
                    cause Harry's death. After being declined by Spider-Man, Harry discovered unstable technology from
                    Oscorp, which transformed him into the Green Goblin, changing his appearance, physical abilities,
                    and affecting his mental stability.

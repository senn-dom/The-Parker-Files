                <p>
                    The Parker Files is an online archive that dives into the life, legacy, and hidden stories of Peter Parker 
                    from The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. From personal discoveries to untold moments and the struggles behind the mask, 
                    this site provides narratives and visual snapshots that explore what it really means to carry great power and the 
                    responsibility that comes with it. This collection offers a closer look at the universe created in the two TASM films.

                An intellectually gifted yet socially introverted teenager struggling to find his place in life ever since 
                his parents died when he was a child. When Peter sneaks inside the Oscorp building where his father worked, 
                a genetically enhanced spider bites him on the back of his neck, giving him inhuman abilities, similar to that of a 
                spider's.
